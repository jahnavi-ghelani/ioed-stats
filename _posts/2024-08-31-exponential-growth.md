**Growth that occurs with repsect to the value of the object. The more you use it, the faster it grows. It's like a snow-ball effect**: as a snowball rolls, it picks up more snow, gets bigger, rolls faster, picks up more snow per roll than before, and so on *exponentially*.

**Linear growth**: object **continues to grow at the same rate.**

**Exponential growth**: object **continues to grow at an increasingly faster rate i.e., <u>the object and its rate of growth are both increasing</u>.**

**Examples** of things that grow exponentially: 
* **Population growth until 50 years back**[^popn]: More people in each generation giving birth to yet more people perpetuates the cycle of exponential population growth.

* **Technology adoption**: As awareness and familiarity of a technology (television, dishwashers, cellphones, etc.) spreads, more people adopt it, governments & private institutions reduce costs and improve the technology leading to accelerated adoption[^techy]. 

* **Sharing of viral content**: The more a viral content is shared, the more exposure it gets, the more opportunity there is for the next batch of content watchers to share it onwards, spreading it like a wildfire.
